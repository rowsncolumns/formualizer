//! Formal effects pipeline for evaluation (ticket 603).
//!
//! An `Effect` is an explicit, inspectable side-effect produced by formula
//! evaluation.  Effects are *planned* deterministically from
//! `(computed_value, workbook_state)` and *applied* sequentially.
//!
//! This separation enables:
//! - Parallel computation with sequential apply
//! - ChangeLog integration at the effect layer
//! - Deterministic replay without re-evaluation
